# Bot-for-wearable-computing-
The project that  created completely explains the model and architecture of an Arduino-based robot used for wildlife protection and accident reduction.
This bot is very useful in the future to protect our wildlife sanctuary and to save the forest and animals.
It can protect animals from accidents by using ultrasonic sensors.
